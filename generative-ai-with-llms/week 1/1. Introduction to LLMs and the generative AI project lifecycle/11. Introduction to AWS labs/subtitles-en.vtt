1
00:00:00.498 --> 00:00:04.673
So you've seen a lot of material so
far in the course, and the best way for

2
00:00:04.673 --> 00:00:08.439
you to solidify these concepts in
your mind is to get hands-on and

3
00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:10.101
try some code for yourself.

4
00:00:10.101 --> 00:00:12.755
As Andrew mentioned,
at the start of this week,

5
00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:16.925
my colleague Chris Fragley led the
development of the labs for this course.

6
00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:21.615
Each week features a lab exercise that
lets you try out the key concepts from

7
00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:22.440
the videos.

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.281
Chris is going to help you get started
by showing you the lab environment.

9
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:29.917
Then he'll walk you through the activity
that you'll complete this week.

10
00:00:29.917 --> 00:00:31.855
Hey, Chris.

11
00:00:31.855 --> 00:00:33.429
>> Hey, thanks, Mike.

12
00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:37.166
And now let's take a look at
the lab environments in lab 1.

13
00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.383
Before actually getting into the lab,
let me explain the system,

14
00:00:40.383 --> 00:00:44.246
the environment that we're going to be
using here, which is called Vocareum.

15
00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:48.878
And so here we will actually
launch your own AWS account

16
00:00:48.878 --> 00:00:53.208
that will give you access
to Amazon SageMaker, and

17
00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:58.560
therefore you can run these
notebooks without any cost to you.

18
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.616
So some things to note when you get
into the Vocareum lab environment,

19
00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:07.828
you want to click Start Lab,
that's the very first thing.

20
00:01:07.828 --> 00:01:11.438
You'll see that up here in the upper left,

21
00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:15.866
you'll see the AWS goes from
red to yellow to green.

22
00:01:15.866 --> 00:01:20.968
So green is good, green means we can
click on this and then get into the lab.

23
00:01:20.968 --> 00:01:22.771
So just a couple of quick things here.

24
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:26.175
You will have 2 hours
to complete each lab,

25
00:01:26.175 --> 00:01:30.959
you don't need to click any sort
of end lab when you're done,

26
00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:36.941
you just close the browser and then move
on to the next lab or video as you wish.

27
00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:39.786
And there are some instructions here, but

28
00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:43.665
I'm going to actually walk
through this with you right now.

29
00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:48.061
So what we want to do is
click on the AWS that will

30
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:51.897
actually launch into the AWS console.

31
00:01:51.897 --> 00:01:58.267
Now, if you are already logged into an AWS
console, you will need to click logout,

32
00:01:58.267 --> 00:02:03.274
and then click back here once again
on that same green AWS button.

33
00:02:03.274 --> 00:02:05.820
I'm going to zoom in a little bit here,

34
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.063
the fastest way to really get to
Sage Maker is to type it into here,

35
00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:13.476
into the search fields and
then click on SageMaker.

36
00:02:13.476 --> 00:02:17.342
What we're trying to do is
get to the SageMaker studio,

37
00:02:17.342 --> 00:02:22.787
which is a Jupyter based IDE that we'll
be doing all of our notebooks in today.

38
00:02:22.787 --> 00:02:27.671
Click on the Open Studio over there, so
real quick, I clicked on Studio here,

39
00:02:27.671 --> 00:02:29.902
then I clicked on Open Studio here.

40
00:02:29.902 --> 00:02:34.182
All of this has been pre-provisioned for
you, so you don't have to do anything.

41
00:02:34.182 --> 00:02:37.214
That'll get you right into
the Jupyter notebook, let me zoom in.

42
00:02:37.214 --> 00:02:39.727
Dark mode is enabled by default,

43
00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:44.138
you can switch off of dark mode
onto light mode if you wish.

44
00:02:44.138 --> 00:02:49.247
You can click Theme and
then switch to JupyterLab Light mode by

45
00:02:49.247 --> 00:02:55.843
default it's the SageMaker UI Dark mode
that is a form of black here that we see.

46
00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:59.936
Now the first step is
to click Open Launcher,

47
00:02:59.936 --> 00:03:04.999
we actually want to go to the System
terminal because the first

48
00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:10.513
thing that we want to do is to
copy the labs from our S3 bucket.

49
00:03:10.513 --> 00:03:15.424
So object storage that's in the cloud,
this is a public bucket

50
00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:19.966
that contains all of the notebooks and
all of the images and

51
00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:24.714
all of the data sets that are needed for
this particular lab.

52
00:03:24.714 --> 00:03:26.960
So now that I'm in the terminal,

53
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.259
I'm actually going to go
back to my instructions.

54
00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:35.753
So we've done all of this, Step 1, click
Studio, Step 2, click the Open Studio.

55
00:03:35.753 --> 00:03:41.421
There is another way to get into Studio,
sometimes learners do stumble upon this.

56
00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:45.425
If you do see this screen somehow,
if you're poking around,

57
00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:50.045
just know that you can click on Launch and
you would click on Studio, and

58
00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:53.603
that'll open up Studio Notebooks
in the same manner.

59
00:03:53.603 --> 00:03:56.629
And then from that point,
all of these instructions are the same,

60
00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.128
clicking Open Launcher,
clicking System terminal.

61
00:03:59.128 --> 00:04:02.280
Now this is the code that I need to copy,

62
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.314
make sure that you get everything up
to that last slash right there, okay?

63
00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:11.091
I'm going to go back into JupyterLab and

64
00:04:11.091 --> 00:04:14.484
I'm just going to paste this right here,
okay?

65
00:04:14.484 --> 00:04:16.954
Next step will be to
click on the folder and

66
00:04:16.954 --> 00:04:19.857
we should see the notebook
that was downloaded.

67
00:04:19.857 --> 00:04:24.823
So because I'm zoomed in so far here,
I have to scroll this over here,

68
00:04:24.823 --> 00:04:26.687
and this is the first lab.

69
00:04:28.641 --> 00:04:32.657
Now, so like I said, all of the compute
has been provisioned for us,

70
00:04:32.657 --> 00:04:35.650
we should just be able to
start running these labs.

71
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.610
Now, if you're not familiar with Jupyter
notebooks, just know that you can do

72
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.843
either Shift+Enter to get,
from notebook to, from cell to cell.

73
00:04:44.843 --> 00:04:48.486
Or if you are feeling
maybe you're in a hurry,

74
00:04:48.486 --> 00:04:52.138
you could do Restart Kernel and
Run All Cells.

75
00:04:52.138 --> 00:04:56.251
And that will actually run all of
the cells with just one click.

76
00:04:56.251 --> 00:05:01.023
For these labs, I would encourage you
to run step by step, so do Shift+Enter,

77
00:05:01.023 --> 00:05:03.028
Shift+Enter, Shift+Enter.

78
00:05:03.028 --> 00:05:07.260
So this is all just markdown right here
saying what this lab is going to do.
